# Music Recommendation System

## Description

The Music Recommendation System project aims to build a personalized music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system collects and preprocesses music data, performs feature engineering to extract relevant features, trains machine learning models using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, popularity-based filtering, and hybrid filtering techniques, and evaluates model performance. The objective is to generate the best music recommendations by predicting based on customization and detecting similar music genres. The recommendation system is then integrated into a user-friendly interface for easy use by end-users, enhancing their music listening experience and engagement.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Obtain API access from the Spotify API.
4. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
5. Set up the necessary configurations for the Spotify API in the project.
6. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`content_based_recys.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
7. Run the notebook cells in sequential order to execute the code and perform the music recommendation analysis.

## Usage

To use the Music Recommendation System:

1. Ensure you have set up the project by following the installation steps mentioned above.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`content_based_recys.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the music data, perform feature engineering, and train the machine learning models.
4. Customize the system based on your preferences, such as selecting genres, artists, or moods.
5. Explore the generated music recommendations and enjoy personalized music suggestions.
6. Integrate the recommendation system into your own user-friendly interface or use the existing interface provided in the project.
