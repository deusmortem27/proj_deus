# Heart Failure Prediction

## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. The result of cardiovascular diseases is Heart Failure.
Heart failure is a chronic illness in which the heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body. This can happen when the heart becomes weakened or injured, such as after a cardiac attack, excessive blood pressure, or other underlying medical issues. Heart failure can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and ankles, among other symptoms. It is a dangerous and frequently fatal disorder that can afflict people of all ages.
Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
Predicting heart failure can help healthcare providers identify people at risk of developing heart failure and intervene early with preventative treatments to enhance outcomes and quality of life in today's society.
Healthcare practitioners can help minimise the incidence of heart failure and enhance the overall health of their patient group by identifying people at risk of heart failure and delivering focused therapies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset we have used is from Kaggle, and this dataset contains 13 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. The features are:
1. Age: The age of the patient in years.
2. Anaemia: Whether the patient has a decrease in red blood cells or haemoglobin in their blood.
3. Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK): The level of CPK enzyme in the patient's blood, which can indicate heart muscle damage.
4. Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes.
5. Ejection Fraction: The percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart with each contraction.
6. High Blood Pressure: Whether the patient has high blood pressure.
7. Platelets: The number of platelets in the patient's blood.
8. Serum Creatinine: The level of creatinine in the patient's blood, which can indicate kidney function.
9. Serum Sodium: The level of sodium in the patient's blood.
10. Sex: The gender of the patient (male or female).
11. Smoking: Whether the patient is a smoker.
12. Time: The amount of time that has passed (in days) since the patient was diagnosed with heart failure and the patient data was collected.
13. Death Event: Whether the patient died during the follow-up period (1 if yes, 0 if no).

## Running the Notebook
To run the Jupyter Notebook file (`your_notebook.ipynb`), follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:
pip install jupyter
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `your_notebook.ipynb` is located.
3. Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
4. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.
5. In the interface, navigate to the directory where `your_notebook.ipynb` is located and click on the notebook file to open it.
6. You can now run the notebook
Note: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies and libraries installed to run the notebook successfully.
